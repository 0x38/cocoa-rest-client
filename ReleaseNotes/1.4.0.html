Fixes/Features in 1.4.0:

* Multiple windows and tabs using macOS's native tab support!
* Saved requests list is now part of each main window rather than a drawer (the drawer concept seems to be poorly supported in today's macOS libraries). 
* New keymappings: Command-N opens a new window, Command-T opens a new tab, and Command-O opens the saved request name searcher. 
* Bottom status bar looks slightly classier.
* Enabling or disabling trust of self-signed certs is now a menu option.
