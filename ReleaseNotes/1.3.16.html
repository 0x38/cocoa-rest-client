Fixes/Features in 1.3.16:

* Command-T now brings up a typeahead fast searcher of saved requests! 
* Tried to standardize request saving behavior with normal MacOS apps: Command-S now saves a request or overwrites a selected request (confirmation box is shown first) and Command-Shift-S works as a 'Save As' to give a request a new name. 
* Decreased font size of saved request drawer to make things look a little cleaner
