Fixes/Features in 1.4.2:

* Of course, if you haven't upgraded to 1.4.x yet, be sure to give it a try since 1.4.0+ versions support new windows and tabbed windows using native macOS tabbing support!

* Added an additional table to input URL parameters; synced with changes to the URL bar. (Issue #67, Issue #56)
* If the requst contains the Accept-Encoding header, append --compressed to a generated curl command so that curl decompresses the response body automatically. (Issue #130)
