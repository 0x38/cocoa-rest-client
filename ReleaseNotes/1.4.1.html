Fixes/Features in 1.4.1:

* Of course, if you haven't upgraded to 1.4.x yet, be sure to give it a try since 1.4.0+ versions support new windows and tabbed windows using native macOS tabbing support!

* No longer automatically sets Accept-Encoding and Accept-Language header fields on outgoing requests (Issue #128). 
* Fixes pre-emptive auth broken in 1.4.0 (Issue #129)
* Remembers the preferred width of the saved requests sidebar
* Adds a submit request menu item mapped to Control-S (Issue #116)
* Remember last Content-Type header selection from Content-Type menu (Issue #81)
* Increases number of visible HTTP Methods in dropdown (Issue #108)
* Fixes minor bug that causes import and export requests functionality to break after Reload Requests Drawer menu item is invoked.
